                            The Beta Version of the Multiplayer draft is now avaliable! This took me way longer 
                            than I thought it would, hence the lack of other updates. If you get the opportunity 
                            please tell your friends and have a go. Report any problems you find to <a href="mailto:chrisberry45@googlemail.com">chrisberry45@googlemail.com</a>. 
                            It would be great to have a very stable finished
                            by the time Journey to the Nyx is fully spoiled.

                            You may have noticed the site was down for a bit this weekend. This was due to the site changing hosting. 
                            This is complete now and there shouldn't be any significant downtime for the foreseeable future! :)

                            Todays changes involve changing the booster inputs to function better on smaller devices rather than
                            going off the edge of the screen as they have previously.

                            I've updated the AIs ratings of the BNG cards to follow those published at Channel Fireball. This

                            The site has now been updated to include Theros Cards. This means the Sealed simulator has been
                            updated so you can play with 3 Theros boosters and 3 Born of the Gods boosters, as in real sealed games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the Theros cards are now added I've taken the opportunity to add them to a number of other places.
                            The draft simulator now includes the Theros cards aswell and gives the option of making drafts with
                            a mixture of Theros and Born of the Gods boosters. The ratings used by the draft AIs are Channel Fireballs ratings
                            which can be found here:
                            <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com/tag/theros-set-review/">http://www.channelfireball.com/tag/theros-set-review/</a>.
                            I will be updated the BNG cards with channel fireballs ratings soon.

                        <p>
                            Theros cards are now browsable in the Card Browser, with a simple button letting you switch between Theros
                            and Born of the Gods cards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cards have also been added to the Booster Simulator, so you can play with Theros Cards, BNG Cards or a
                            mixture of the two.

                            Beyond the Theros additions I've updated this page to include buttons taking you to the various pages. This

                            I've applied a small update to the layout today. Hopefully this will make the text easier

                            I've also added a fix to the simulators so the same card cannot appear twice in a booster pack.
                            I still need to add foil cards but these should come soon.

                            I've applied a small update today. Images should now begin to load when you reach the

                            I've added additional sorting to the draft, booster and sealed simulators. Now the
                            cards are sorted by rarity and then by color, giving you a clearer view of what you've
                            opened.

                            The AI in the drafts were also not working as planned but this has now been rectified.
                            AI's now properly make decisions about what colors they are going to use in a draft.

                            I'm loving some of the new blue cards such as the Vortex Elemental and the Perplexing Chimera.
                            The first threatens to take something down with it, an excellent deterant in multiplayer games.
                            If you get the Chimera out you can force your opponent into some difficult decisions. As I read
                            it the steal ability will include all spells including creatures which makes playing a more powerful
                            creature a risky move. It could also be heaps of fun in multiplayer with the Chimera getting passed
                            all over the table.

                            Today we get to see a full cycle of commons. The Nyxborn cycle includes a bestow creature
                            from every color. None of these are particularly exciting however, as other than the bestow
                            ability they are all vanilla and none of them appear like they'll be particularlly powerful
                            in any format.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oracle of Bones is the most interesting card revealed today. Its tribute cost involves your
                            opponent choosing between giving it 2 +1/+1 counters or allowing you to cast a instant or
                            sorcery from your hand for free. As this guy has haste it forces the opponent into an immediate
                            and difficult decision. This could potentially be very powerful in a draft and could even be used
                            in constructed. I love cards that give you the opportunity to bluff and I could see myself holding
                            onto a land to try and gain a few free counters.
                            even be useful in constructed.

                            There has also been a few website updates today. I've fixed the messages so you get useful messages
                            when your adding cards to your pool in a draft or in the sealed simulator. There are also messages
                            alerting you when you've begun a new draft or how many boosters you've opened in the booster simulator.

                            Wizards revealed 2 new rares, one mythic and 2 uncommon cards today. These included
                            the card I was most excited about: Phenax. Unfortunetly, Phenax is a mill card. After
                            attempting to build a mill deck for a while myself I've always found them fairly
                            underwhelming as a main strategy, not to mention uninteresting as the other players
                            actions are largely ignored. However, Phenax would go very nicely in a Commander deck
                            and would work wonders in drafts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whelming wave was also revealed today. This sends all creatures back to their owners hands
                            <b>except</b> Krakens, Octopus, Leviathans and Serpants. On the surface this doesn't seem that
                            interesting but it does suggest there is a potential for more giant sea creature tribal cards
                            to be release.

                            Five new cards have been added today. This includes the 5 color bestow beast, Chromanticore. As
                            you'd expect from a five colored creature, it takes abilities from each of the colors. Although
                            its a cool card I imagine it'll be very difficult to use in a draft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most powerful card revealed today is the Spirit of the Labyrinth. A 3/1 for 2 mana provides will
                            provide a great boost for white weenie decks. The power alone would make the card decent but it also
                            comes with an ability which prevents players drawing more than 1 card a turn. This has the potential to
                            cause issues for control decks. Most control decks would have plenty of ways to deal with a 1 toughness
                            creature so how useful this creature will be remains to be seen.

                            <a href="http://www.mtgmirror.com/#/about">About</a> section.

                        <p>
                            Wizards of the Coast have currently only revealed 54 cards. This means the drafting system
                            doesn't currently make a lot of sense with only two commons revealed. As Wizards spoil more
                            cards this facility will continue to improve.
                        </p>

                            The new cards include some new mechanics such as 'Inspired' which triggers when a creature untaps
                            and the very interesting 'Tribute' where your opponent can put a number of +1/+1 counters on the
                            creature or the creature performs another action such as fighting players or gaining haste. I'm a big
                            fan of mechanics that force players to make difficult decisions and I'm excited to see some powerful
                            creatures with this ability.

                            Theres also been a number of duel coloured Gods revealed including the White/Blue God, the Green/White
                            God, the Red/Black God and the Red/Green God. We're still waiting for the god of my favourite color
                            combo, Black/Blue.
